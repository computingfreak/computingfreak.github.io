It is very important that we list goals & milestones and celebrate upon accomplishing them.
I finished reading the book: ![A book about hope by Mark Manson](https://source.unsplash.com/MvLRTUqOdvo)

And another short one - the Serve No Master Book Zero titled

![Fire your boss](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/P/B07K7ZQD82.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_SX500_.jpg)

"Fire Your Boss" : How to quit your job, stop selling your time and start making passive income while you sleepâ€¦and possibly move to a tropical island

Here is my reading list and bookshelf at [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com/computingfreak)

I watched the docufilm on Netflix : "Downfall : The case against Boeing"
